- 👋 Hi, I’m @biffabacon
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Music (HiFi and 'playing' guitar), walking my hound and trying to improve productivity with IT.
      Latest (very simple) example: thought i'd treat myself to a better keyboard as last one creaking and not capturing all my taps.
      Just bought a mech., fancy dan wireless effort with flashing lights...regretted it almost instantly. Persevering for now but probably
      be going to plan B or C soon.
      On actual software/real computing front, am open to offers. Suppose broadly I'd say areas of security and personal organisation.
      i.e. getting more done in a secure a way as possible so can spend less time doing any of this stuff/more on other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... guitar (always learning), Java...both somewhat slowly unfortunately.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure you'd want me for anything plus am too busy at home already tbf
- 📫 How to reach me ... Umm, what're the usual routes?
